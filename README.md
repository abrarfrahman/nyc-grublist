**The Del**
Thursday Kitchen – Korean fusion, famous for their capri sun drinks (usually a long line and they don’t take reservations so get there early)

Joe’s Pizza + Prince Street Pizza – People say these are some of the best pizza spots in NYC

Emmy Squared – My personal pizza place but you also need to get the burger!

Lil’ Frankies – Great for group dinner if people want Italian (I think it’s cash only)

Red Lion – Live music bar

Phebe’s – Known for being the bar where all interns go

San Marzano & Carroll Place – Good, affordable brunch spots!

Levain Bakery – Best cookies in NYC!
